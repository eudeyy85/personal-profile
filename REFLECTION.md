# Main Concepts
The main concept is to make my personal profile which was made in figma to be made same with the code using html and css.

# New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
In this I learned to make background with a looping video, to import icons from a CDN for social links and even came to know about the element z-index.

# What you learned
I learned the uses of anchor tags (<a>) for each link to  style it, to make paragraphs (<p>) and to make space between paragraphs, to add button with the class "portfolio-btn" and "contact-btn". Even learn to style social media icons, uses absolute positioning and z-index to layer elements on top of each other, to create a navigation bar with links to other sections of the website of my personal profile.

# Challenges I faced 
I didn't know how to import video to make it as background, the images and textes were not in the place I wanted it to be, the images overlap with text, didn't know how import icons but in the end this problem were solved and some i couldn't even after getting help from the internet, video lesson, AI and other friends whom knew it.
